# Game Demo

This is a demo of the ladder game created using Pygame.

A fast-paced ladder-climbing platformer demo built with Pygame. The player navigates interconnected ladders and platforms, times parabolic jumps to traverse gaps, avoids hazards, and collects power-ups to boost score and survive longer.Players need to wave their hands in front of the camera to control the character's jump, gesture recognition program is used to detect the movement and correspondingly transfer it into the ladder game.

Gameplay
- Move horizontally across platforms and climb ladders to reach higher areas.
- Use parabolic jumps to cross gaps and reach bonus zones.

Controls
- Left / Right: move horizontally
- Jump (Space or Up): perform a parabolic jump
- Optional: experimental gesture-based controls (requires a camera and the optional dependencies)

Art style
This demo is designed to evoke a cyberpunk pixel-art aesthetic — neon highlights, gritty urban backdrops, and retro-style sprites that blend futuristic vibes with nostalgic pixel visuals.

Notes
- Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and run the game with `python main.py`.
- The repository intentionally excludes the virtual environment; create your own virtualenv and install dependencies locally.
